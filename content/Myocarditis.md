# Myopericarditis

- Nomenclature: Pericarditis with known or clinically suspected concomitant myocardial involvement should be referred to as **'myopericarditis'**, while predominant myocarditis with pericardial involvement should be referred to as **'perimyocarditis'**, according to Task Force consensus.
- The diagnosis of predominant pericarditis with myocardial involvement, or **'myopericarditis'**, can be clinically established if patients with definite criteria for acute pericarditis show elevated biomarkers of myocardial injury (troponin I or T, CK-MB fraction) without newly developed focal or diffuse impairment of left ventricular function in echocardiography or CMR.
- Think **perimyocarditis** if evidence of new-onset focal or diffuse reduction of left ventricular function in patients with elevated myocardial biomarkers and clinical criteria for acute pericarditis
- Diagnosis
	- Cath
		- r/o ACS
	- [[Cardiac MRI]]
		- Confirm myocardial involvement and r/o ischemic myocardial necrosis in absence of significant CAD
- Management
	- Similar to [[Pericarditis#Acute Pericarditis|acute pericarditis]], but activity restriction extends to at least 6 months
