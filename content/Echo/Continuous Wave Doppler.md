In the CWD mode, the transducer has two crystals: one to send and the other to receive the reflected waves continuously. âˆ´, the maximal frequency shift that can be recorded is not limited by the pulsed repetition frequency or the Nyquist limit as with [[Pulsed Wave Doppler|PWD]]. Unlike [[Pulsed Wave Doppler|PWD]], ==CWD measures all the frequency shifts (i.e., velocities) present along its beam path==; hence, it is used to detect and record the highest flow velocity accessible. (Oh, Chapter 4)

- Range ambiguous
- Continuous bursts of ultrasound to receive reflected wave
- Recording of all velocities along the ultrasound beam
- The main goal of CWD is to obtain the highest flow velocity along its path, so that intracardiac or intrapulmonary pressures can be estimated, and pressure gradient across a stenotic or regurgitant orifice can be calculated.
- Occasionally, recording of a high-velocity flow is the first clue to an unsuspected lesion within the path of a CWD beam. (Oh, Chapter 4)
