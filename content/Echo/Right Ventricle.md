- The RV is much more sensitive to [[Afterload|afterload]] changes than the LV
	- b/c RV has lower systolic elastance compared to the LV
	- LV is a thicker, more muscular ventricle, ‚à¥ the LV is able to handle ‚Üë afterload. This is *not* the case for the RV. For example, in acute PE the right heart can struggle.

## Assessment of RV Size

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that (as with the LV) make your measurements at the compacted/non-compacted interface.

![[Pasted image 20240806131724.png]]

The conventional [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|apical four-chamber view]] (i.e., focused on the left ventricle) results in considerable variability in how the right heart is sectioned, and consequently, RV linear dimensions and areas may vary widely in the same patient with relatively minor rotations in transducer position (Figure 7B). ==RV dimensions are best estimated from a RV-focused apical four-chamber view obtained with either lateral or medial transducer orientation== (Figure 7A and Table 7). Care should be taken to obtain the image with the LV apex at the center of the scanning sector, while displaying the largest basal RV diameter and thus avoiding foreshortening. Of note, the accuracy of RV measurements may be limited when the RV free wall is not well defined because of the dimension of the ventricle itself or its position behind the sternum. Recent data have suggested that indexing RV "size" to BSA may be relevant in some circumstances, but the measurements used in those studies lacked the reference points of the RV-focused view and frequently used RV areas, rather than linear dimensions.

> [!tldr]- Rules of Thumb for RV Dilatation
> In general, a **diameter >41 mm at the base** (widest part of the basal 1/3rd of the RV; do NOT measure at the annulus) and **>35 mm at the midlevel** in the RV-focused view indicates RV dilatation. [^ase-2015]

- In the **standard** [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)]] view, you are just eyeballing to compare the RV size against the LV size.
	- üìù if the LV is enlarged and the RV looks "normal," it is not actually *normal*, rather it may also be enlarged.
- The **standard** [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]] view is *NOT* the view you want to measure your RV in.
	- **RV modified A4C View**: pull R heart into view and remove the LV from the picture ‚Üí RV apex is at the top of the view.
	- üåü**RV focused A4C View**: LV apex is at the top of the view, but angulated transducer to tip the RV into better view. This view allows you to measure the maximal RV diameter.
		- This is the view that you will want to use to take measurements for RV size

See the following image from [^rv-echo-view] that helps illustrate the importance of getting the optimal view for RV size assessment:

### RV Size Reference Values

Reference values for RV dimensions are listed in Table 8. [^ase-2015]

## Assessment of RV Function
### TAPSE

See [[Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)]]
### Fractional Area Change (Poor Man's EF)

- Obtain in RV focused [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]] view
- Values < 35% are consistent with RV dysfunction

$$
\text{FAC } (\%) = \frac{(\text{RV Area}_{\text{end diastolic}} - \text{RV Area}_{\text{end systolic}})}{\text{RV Area}_{\text{end diastolic}}} \times 100
$$
### RV Index of Myocardial Perfusion (RIMP)


> [!warning] Probably should NOT use to assess RV systolic/diastolic function (at least not in isolation)
> 

- aka Tei Index
- Global indicator of systolic and diastolic dysfunction
- Based on Doppler timing:
	- [[Tricuspid Regurgitation|tricuspid regurgitant]] tracing (interval denoted by $a$ in the figure below)
		- measuring TV closure to opening time, i.e. the width of the [[Tricuspid Regurgitation|TR]] jet
		- Folks will measure the tricuspid valve closure-to-open time using either [[Pulsed Wave Doppler|PWD]] in [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]] view at the level of the tip of the tricuspid leaflets or [[Tricuspid Regurgitation|TR]] jet with [[Continuous Wave Doppler|CWD]].
	- RVOT ejection time ($\text{ET}_{\text{RVOT}}$)
	- üìù Looks at isovolemic contraction (IVCT) and relaxation (IVRT) times
- Relatively independent of HR or afterload
- Modestly prognostic in [[Pulmonary Hypertension]], right-heart disease
- Why you probably shouldn't use it?
	- Underestimates severity of disease
	- Do NOT use in isolation
	- Not recommended to follow patients with right-heart disease

$$
\text{RIMP} = \frac{(\text{IVCT + IVRT})}{\text{ET}_{\text{RVOT}}} = \frac{(\text{TV Closure-to-Open Time} - \text{ET}_{\text{RVOT}})}{\text{ET}_{\text{RVOT}}}
$$

### RV Systolic Strain

Longitudinal strain is calculated as the percentage of systolic shortening of the RV free wall from base to apex, while longitudinal strain rate is the rate of this shortening. [^ase-2015]

- Abnormal if values are *less negative* than -25% (or lower than 25% in absolute value)
	- üìù Mayo Board Review uses 25% number, whereas [^ase-2015] uses 20%.
	- Importantly, the cutoff value is a higher number than that used for strain with LV
- Should be measured in the RV-focused [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]] view
- Speckle tracking longitudinal strain
- Angle independent
- Not prone to translational motion
- Most studies focus on the free wall

# RV After Cardiac Surgery

With any cardiac surgery, you typically see an acute reduction in RV longitudinal contractility. But there is a compensatory increase in radial function. ‚à¥ post-op, you will expect to find [[Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)|TAPSE]] or S' are low but [[Right Ventricle#Fractional Area Change (Poor Man's EF)|FAC]] or EF are preserved. This tends to resolve overtime.
- **Lesson**: in post-cardiac surgery patients, don't call RV dysfunction based on [[Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)|TAPSE]] or **S'** alone.
