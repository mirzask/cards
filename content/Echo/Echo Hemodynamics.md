- E/e' is sometimes used as a proxy for [[LV End Diastolic Pressure (LVEDP)]] [^ommen]
	- ![M-LVDP versus groups defined by values of septal E/E′. ○ Indicates patients with EF <50%; •, patients with EF >50%.](https://www.ahajournals.org/cms/10.1161/01.CIR.102.15.1788/asset/4ea75c24-bf0f-4034-95e9-5c932256a63d/assets/graphic/hc4004570006.jpeg)

- Variation in the E velocity on **mitral inflow** ([[Echo Doppler|Doppler]]) is a clue that the [[Left Atrial Pressure|LAP]] is not elevated. By contrast, E velocity that is > 100 cm/s (> 1 m/s) and *fixed* may indicate an elevated [[Left Atrial Pressure|LAP]].
	- Dr. Oh made note of this in case of patient with [[Atrial Fibrillation|AFib]] where E velocity varied from 80 to 100 cm/s

## Mitral Inflow

- [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]] view with the sampling volume (=) 1 cm distal to the MV annulus or at the leaflet tips during diastole, with a sampling gate of 1 to 3 mm.
- E velocity
	- peak early diastolic velocity
	- The mitral E wave represents the LA-LV gradient during early diastole and thus is **preload-dependent**. [^ase-monitor]
- A velocity
	- The mitral A wave is the LA-LV gradient during *late* diastole and is affected by changes in LV diastolic function and LA compliance.[^ase-monitor]
- E/A ratio
- Deceleration Time
- e' velocities (using [[Tissue Doppler]])
	- e' measures the peak *early* velocity of the mitral annulus
	- e' velocity is less sensitive to preload than other measures
		- some may go as far as to say it is preload-independent, i.e. "the e' velocity never changes," which is mostly true, but overly simplistic as it's not 100% insensitive to preload
		- Studies have found e' to be *less* preload dependent than other measures of diastolic function, such as mitral inflow and pulmonary vein flow velocities.[^ase-monitor]
	- ⚠️ septal mitral annular e' measurements may not accurately reflect LV diastolic function in the setting of septal wall motion abnormalities or RV dysfunction [^ase-monitor]
- E/e'
	- reliable estimate of LAP when systolic function is normal [^ase-monitor]
## IVC (Subcostal)

- Measure the IVC 1-2 cm away from the RA, inner-to-inner
- Abnormal IVC dilation if > 2.1 cm
- IVC collapsibility
	- Ask patient to sniff
	- If > 50% collapse → normal
	- If < 50% collapse → abnormal
- Volume assessment
	- Inspiration in normovolemic, spontaneously breathing patients causes negative intrathoracic pressure and a decrease in IVC size. An exaggerated response in IVC collapse occurs in patients in the hypovolemic state during inspiration. [^ase-monitor]
- Ventilated patients
	- Because IVC collapse will not occur in patients on positive pressure ventilation due to inspiration-induced reductions in venous return, it should not be used to monitor RAP in this setting.[^ase-monitor]

| IVC Size (cm) | IVC Collapsibility | Estimated RAP (mean; mmHg) |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| ≤ 2.1 cm      | > 50%              | 0-5 (3); Normal            |
| > 2.1 cm      | > 50%              | 5-10 (8); Indeterminate    |
| ≤ 2.1 cm      | <50%               | 5-10 (8); Indeterminate    |
| > 2.1 cm      | <50%               | 10-20 (15); High           |

## RV

- [[Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE)|TAPSE]]
- RV s' velocity

## [[Tricuspid Regurgitation|TR]] jet

- Views include [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]], PSAX, and RV inflow on TTE
	- Use the view with the highest velocity signal for serial measurements as this represents the most parallel alignment
# [[Atrial Fibrillation]]

- e' velocities might not be as low as expected (compared to sinus rhythm)
	- **<u>septal</u> E/e' ≥ 11** as the cutoff in [[Atrial Fibrillation|AFib]]
		- recall that in sinus rhyth, the normal septal E/e' cutoff is 15, whereas the average E/e' cutoff is 14
		- 🌟All of the studies for E/e' assessment in [[Atrial Fibrillation|AFib]] were done using <u>septal</u> E/e'
	- In [[Atrial Fibrillation|AFib]] you lack the atrial contraction, so most of the flow of blood into the ventricle is during early diastole (E velocity).
- Take advantage of ancillary data when patient is in [[Atrial Fibrillation|AFib]]
	- normal RVSP argues against high filling pressures
	- abnormal IVC suggest high filling pressures
- Dr. Oh mentioned that LA strain has yet to be fully validated in [[Atrial Fibrillation|AFib]] and may not be as useful compared to use in patients with sinus rhythm.
