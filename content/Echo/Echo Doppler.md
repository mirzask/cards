Doppler frequency changes depending on the direction and the velocity of a moving object, which in the case of cardiac echocardiography tends to involve RBCs in circulation or myocardial tissue (e.g. mitral annulus).

"When an ultrasound beam with known frequency ($f_o$) is reflected by the red blood cells (RBCs) or myocardial tissue, the frequency of the reflected ultrasound waves ($f_r$) increases when the red blood cells or the myocardium is moving toward the source of ultrasound. Conversely, the frequency of reflected ultrasound waves decreases when the red blood cells are moving away from the source. The change in frequency between the transmitted sound and the reflected sound is termed the frequency shift ($\Delta f$) or the Doppler shift ($f_r − f_o$). The Doppler shift depends on the transmitted frequency ($f_o$), the velocity of the moving target ($v$), and the angle ($\theta$) between the ultrasound beam and the direction of the moving target as expressed in the Doppler equation."

"If the angle θ is 0 degree (i.e., the ultrasound beam is parallel with the direction of blood flow), the maximal frequency shift is measured because the cosine of 0 degree is 1. Note that as angle θ increases, the corresponding cosine becomes progressively less than 1, and this will result in underestimation of the Doppler shift (Δf) and hence peak velocity."
