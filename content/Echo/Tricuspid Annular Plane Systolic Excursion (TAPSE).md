- **Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion** (TAPSE) is a measurement of the systolic longitudinal displacement of the lateral tricuspid annulus towards the apex
	- Measures distance of the tricuspid annulus moving up towards the apex during systole
- TAPSE is less preload dependent than other markers of RV function and is performed in patients using both TTE and TEE. [^ase-monitor]
- Measured using [[M-mode]] echocardiography in the [[Apical 4-Chamber (A4C)|A4C]] to assess [[Right Ventricle|right ventricular]] function
	- the M-mode cursor is directed through the lateral annulus of the tricuspid valve, and the distance of annular motion during systole is measured longitudinally [^ase-monitor]
	- the view that provides optimal longitudinal alignment should be used.
- [[Specificity|Specific]], modestly [[Sensitivity|sensitive]]
- Prognostic in [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
- Whereas TAPSE measures **distance**, you can also measure the **velocity** of this movement using [[Tissue Doppler]] â†’ **S'** (peak systolic velocity)
	- An S' velocity < 9.5 cm/sec measured on the free-wall side indicates RV systolic dysfunction. [^ase-2015]
