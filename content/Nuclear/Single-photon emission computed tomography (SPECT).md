- SPECT acquisition
	- Elliptical orbit
		- Heart distance changes for each rotation
		- Resolution variations can occur between projections
		- May cause image artifacts in the apex (defect), base and septum (decreased counts)
	- Circular orbit
		- Heart is near the center of the rotation
		- Resolution approximately the same for all projections
		- Some projections further away from body
- Acquisition Parameters
	- Matrix: 64x64 or 128x128 - generally accepted
	- Pixel Size: 6 - 6.5 mm (Typical Extrinsic Resolution)
	- Projections: 32 to 64
	- Time per projection: 25 to 50 seconds
	- 180° or 360° arc obtained
- Solid State SPECT Imaging systems (Digital SPECT)
	- Spectrum Dynamics
		- We have the Veriton now
	- GE Discovery
	- Phantom Data Anger vs Digital [[Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)]]
		- Veriton has much better spatial resolution → you can discern many more of the black dots in the figure below with the Veriton

# Who is suitable for SPECT?

- Lower likelihood patients
- Lower risk patients
- No prior history of HFrEF or prior MI
- Able to exercise to an adequate level
- Relatively normal body habitus and BMI
- Previous study had good quality images
- McGhie: "If I'm going to go with pharmacologic, I would prefer [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PET]], but sometimes insurance won't pay for it. I don't order very many stress echo or stress SPECT."

# Collimators

- Collimators are the "focusing" device of a SPECT camera
- Made up of holes (usually parallel)
- Exclude photons not traveling parallel to the hole
- Rated by sensitivity and resolution
	- inverse relationship (↑ resolution, ↓ sensitivity)
- See Eric's slides for diff flavors of collimators
