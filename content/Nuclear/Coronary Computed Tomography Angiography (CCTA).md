- CCTA can visualize and help to diagnose the extent and severity of non-obstructive and obstructive CAD, as well as atherosclerotic plaque composition and high-risk features (e.g., positive remodeling, low attenuation plaque).[^cp]
- Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that can detect significant coronary artery stenoses and coronary atherosclerotic plaque.[^asia]
- You can also subsequently calculate [[Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)|fractional flow reserve]] with CT (FFR-CT), e.g. with HeartFlow.
- Who should you calculate FFR-CT on?
	- Patients with coronary artery stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or middle coronary segment on CCTA *may benefit* from measurement of FFR-CT [^cp]
- CCTA has high [[Negative Predictive Value]] for excluding significant plaque or coronary stenosis [^asia]
- Current radiation dosimetry is low for CCTA, with effective doses for most patients in the 3 to 5 mSv range[^cp]
- The presence of significant stenosis in CCTA does not always mean the presence of ischemia-causing stenosis, ∴ presence of epicardial stenosis or atherosclerotic plaque on CCTA does not exclude the possibility of [[Ischemia with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (INOCA)|INOCA]].[^asia] 
# Who is a poor candidate for CCTA?

> [!NOTE] Ideal HR for CCTA
> Want HR <70 and ideally <60

- Arrhythmia, including frequent PACs or PVCs
- CEID, e.g. ICD
- Extensive [[Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)|CAC]]
	- Go back and check out prior CT scans and see if there is any calcium present (may not have been commented on by the radiology reads)
- Prior history of [[Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)]]
- Renal dysfunction
- Contrast allergy
- Obesity
	- McGhie prefers to avoid CCTA if BMI > 35
