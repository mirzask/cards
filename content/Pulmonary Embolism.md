# McConnell's Sign

- Akinesis of RV free wall
- Preservation (or even hyperdynamic appearance) of RV apex
- Although often taught in the context of acute PE, it is a non-[[Specificity|specific]] finding as it can also be seen with other conditions. Examples in the Mayo Board Review course included ARDS, Sepsis, Pulmonary Hemorrhage, and COPD/respiratory failure.
	- Presence more likely suggests *acute* process and is suggestive moreso of *acute* [[Right Heart Failure]]
- If you do strain studies, the RV apex is not actually normal. Rather, the RV apex is often akinetic. The preserved/hyperdynamic appearance of the RV apex is instead likely due to a tethering effect of hyperdynamic LV apex. [^alc-echo]
