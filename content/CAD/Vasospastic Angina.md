- Vasospastic angina is also called **Prinzmetal angina** or **variant angina**.
- Caused by spasm of a coronary artery ‚Üí transient flow-limiting obstruction ‚Üí angina 
- üìù A patient can have **BOTH**, i.e. concomitant <u>epicardial</u> and <u>microvascular</u> [[Vasospastic Angina|vasospastic angina]]
	- coexistence confirmed in cases with microvascular vasospasm occurring with a lower dose of [[Acetylcholine|acetylcholine]] than epicardial artery spasm
- "Although it may potentially co-exist with coronary microvascular disorders and/or structural coronary artery disease, VSA is a clinical entity that is centred on the hyper-reactivity of large coronary arteries to vasoconstrictor stimuli." [^beltrame]
- Symptoms classically occur at rest, often from midnight to early AM. However, we now know that vasospastic angina can also occur with stress (physical/psychological) or even spontaneously.
- Main risk factor is cigarette smoking üö¨
- Provoking factors include alcohol üç∫, hyperventilation, [[Epinephrine|epi]], [[Norepinephrine|NE]], cocaine, meth, exposure to cold temperature, exercise.
- Diagnosis
	- Cath: observe spontaneous episode or [[Ischemia with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (INOCA)#Provocative Testing|provocative testing]] (typically with intracoronary [[Acetylcholine|acetylcholine]]) ‚Üí 
		- "A positive provocative test for coronary artery spasm must induce all of the following in response to the provocative stimulus: (i) reproduction of the usual chest pain, (ii) ischemic ECG changes, and (iii) >90% vasoconstriction on angiography. The test result is considered equivocal if the provocative stimulus does not induce all three components." [^beltrame]

	- Classically: transient ST elevations are seen during an episode of chest discomfort *without* significant epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD) on cath. However, now that we recognize it can occur spontaneously or with stress, it is most often seen with ST depression and/or peaked T waves.
		- "Documenting ischemic ECG changes during spontaneous episodes of rest angina occurs infrequently so that **coronary artery spasm provocative testing** is often required." [^beltrame]

# Management

- üö≠ [[Smoking Cessation]] and avoiding other provoking agents
- Acute: [[Nitroglycerin|nitroglycerin]]
- [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]], such as amlodipine and diltiazem to prevent vasoconstriction.
- +/- long-acting [[Nitrates|nitrates]] (use in combination with [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]])
- Timing of Rx
	- Considering the diurnal variation of vasospastic attack, prescription time can be an important issue. To prevent angina in the early morning or at midnight, medication before sleep, not after dinner, can be useful to prevent the symptom [^asia]
