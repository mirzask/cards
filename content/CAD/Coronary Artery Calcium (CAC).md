- Uses **non-contrast CT** with a fixed threshold of 130 Hounsfield units (HUs) for calcium detection
- With modern scanners and protocols, the radiation dose required for acquisition of a CT calcium score is approximately 1 mSV.
- Weighting
	- A weight of 1 is given for attenuation of 130 to 199
	- 2 for 200 to 299
	- 3 for 300 to 399
	- 4 for attenuation â‰¥400
	- The weighting factor is multiplied by the area of each lesion, with the sum of values for all lesions used to determine the total Agatston score
# Power of Zero (CAC of 0)

- What does a zero coronary artery calcium score tell us?
	- <u>Intermediate Risk</u> w/ dyspnea or classic angina
		- 16% incidence inducible ischemia on [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PET]]
	- <u>High Risk</u> Symptomatic Patients in ED w/ ACS
		- 70% prevalence of obstructive [[Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)|CAD]] by [[Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA)|CCTA]]
- ðŸŒŸ Negative CAC is helpful in **Low** and **Intermediate** Risk population (but not high-risk populations)
