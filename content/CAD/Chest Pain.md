Chest pain
- Initial troponin ***
	- Continue to trend troponins to peak every 1-3 hrs for hsTn (3-6 hrs if conventional troponin assays)
- ECG: ***
	- If nondiagnostic, consider serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes including if CP recurs or clinical deterioration
- CXR to r/o other potential cardiac, pulmonary, and thoracic causes
- Optimize GDMT/anti-anginal therapy (if known CAD)
- Work-up to exclude other causes of CP

# Chest Pain

![[Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)-20240923102638720.webp]]
Schema [source](https://clinicalproblemsolving.com/dx-schema-chest-pain/)

- Description of chest pain can be helpful[^cp]
	- Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes.
	- Triggers
		- physical exercise
		- emotional stress
	- Associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting [^cp]
	- ⚠️ Relief with [[Nitroglycerin|nitroglycerin]] is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion.
	- ![[Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)-20240923100504827.webp|475]]
- Differential diagnosis
	- *Sharp* chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease (e.g., these symptoms usually occur with [[Pericarditis|acute pericarditis]]) [^cp]
	- *Sudden onset* of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome (e.g., [[Aortic Dissection|aortic dissection]]).[^cp]
	- Ripping chest pain (“worse chest pain of my life”), especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a [[Hypertension|hypertensive]] patient, or with a known [[Bicuspid Aortic Valve|bicuspid aortic valve]] or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome (e.g., [[Aortic Dissection|aortic dissection]]).
	- Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia.[^cp]
	- Positional chest pain is usually nonischemic (e.g., musculoskeletal)[^cp]
- Pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered **anginal equivalents**.[^cp]
- ⚠️ Avoid the term 'atypical chest pain'. Instead, use “cardiac,” “possible cardiac,” and “noncardiac” to describe the suspected cause of chest pain[^cp]
- **Anginal equivalents** (e.g., new-onset/↑ DOE, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, unexplained fatigue, or syncope) may occur in those who are...
	- older (e.g., ≥75 years of age)
	- female
	- [[Diabetes|diabetes mellitus]]
	- renal dysfunction
	- dementia

# Cardiac Testing

Test selection should be based on **patient risk and pre-test likelihood of CAD** and may be influenced by site expertise and availability[^cp]

[^cp] recommends using [[Chest Pain#Risk Scores for Patient Stratification|clinical decision pathways (CDPs)]] to categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk.

## Intermediate-risk Patients

### Intermediate Risk with known [[Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)|CAD]]

- High-risk CAD features include:
	- left main disease
	- proximal LAD disease
	- multivessel CAD
- Class 1 indication for invasive coronary angiography for a patient with intermediate-risk p/w acute chest pain with high-risk CAD.
