- **Contraindications**
	- Poor windows
	- Unable to reach target HR
	- Uncontrolled [[Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)|HF]]
	- High-risk unstable angina, active ACS or AMI (<2 d)
	- Serious ventricular arrhythmia or high risk for arrhythmias attributable to QT prolongation
	- Respiratory failure
	- Severe COPD, [[Pulmonary Embolism|acute PE]], severe [[Pulmonary Hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]]
	- Contraindications to [[Dobutamine|dobutamine]] (if pharmacologic stress test needed)
	- Severe systemic arterial [[Hypertension|hypertension]] (e.g., â‰¥200/110 mm Hg)
- Useful if patient can exercise and ECG uninterpretable
- Widely available & easy to perform
- Inexpensive
- No ionizing radiation
- Body habitus and echo window
- Qualitative interpretation
- Limited sensitivity (~70%) but better specificity (~80%)
- For detection of CAD, stress echocardiography has similar sensitivity to tomographic nuclear perfusion imaging.
- However, stress echocardiography has higher specificity (89% vs. 77%).
- For detection of left main or multivessel CAD, stress echocardiography has greater sensitivity.

- Indications
	- Known or suspected coronary artery disease
	- Myocardial viability
	- Dyspnea of possible cardiac origin
	- Pulmonary hypertension
	- Mitral valve disease
	- Aortic stenosis
	- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
		- e.g. don't have 30 mmHg threshold at rest echo
- Interpretation
	- At least two adjacent segments are required for test positivity.
	- The wall motion score index (WMSI) is derived by dividing the sum of the scores of individual segments by the number of segments visualized (severely abnormal > 1.7).
		- 1.2 - 1.7 is moderate

> [!tip] Focus on the **apex**
> Talal recommends focus on the **apex** when assessing stress echo. LAD ischemia?

- Wall motion abnormalities in the absence of significant angiographic coronary stenosis should have you thinking of the following:
	- Microvascular abnormalities
	- Endothelial dysfunction
	- Vasospasm
	- Small vessel CAD
	- Apical ballooning syndrome
	- [[content/Amyloidosis]]
