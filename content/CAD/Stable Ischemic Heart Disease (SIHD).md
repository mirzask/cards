# Guideline-directed Medical Therapy

- [[Hyperlipidemia|Lipid Management]]
- [[Hypertension|BP control]]
	- Goal <140/90 [^sihd]
- [[Diabetes]] control
- [[Smoking Cessation]]
- ðŸŒŸ [[Aspirin]] ðŸ’Š
	- aspirin 75 to 162 mg daily should be continued indefinitely in the absence of contraindications in patients with SIHD [^sihd] (Class 1)
		- Can swap for [[Clopidogrel|clopidogrel]] if [[Aspirin|aspirin]] is contraindicated [^sihd]
- ðŸŒŸ [[Beta-blockers]] ðŸ’Š, namely <u>carvedilol</u>, <u>metoprolol succinate</u>, or <u>bisoprolol</u>
	- continue for at least 3 years in all patients with normal LV function after MI or ACS [^sihd]
	- use in all patients with [[Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)|EF â‰¤40%]] or prior MI, unless contraindicated [^sihd]
- ðŸŒŸ [[Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi)|RAASi]] ðŸ’Š
	- *if* pt has [[Hypertension|hypertension]], [[Diabetes|diabetes]], [[Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)|LVEF â‰¤40%]], or CKD, unless contraindicated [^sihd]
- Annual influenza vaccination
- [[Anti-Anginal Therapy]] ðŸ’Š

# Cardiac Testing

## Stable Chest Pain and <u>No Known CAD</u>

- **Anatomic Testing**
	- If intermediate-to-high risk, then [[Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA)|CCTA]] is effective for diagnosis of [[Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)|CAD]], for risk stratification, and for guiding treatment decisions (Class 1A) [^cp]
- **[[Cardiac Stress Testing|Stress Testing]]** for intermediate-to-high risk patients
	- [[Cardiac Stress Testing|Stress imaging]] with [[Stress Echocardiography|stress echo]], [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PET]]/[[Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)|SPECT]] MPI or [[Stress Cardiac MRI|CMR]] is effective for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and for estimating risk of MACE (Class 1B) [^cp]
		- [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PET]] is preferred over [[Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)|SPECT]] (Class 2a) to improve diagnostic accuracy and decrease the rate of nondiagnostic test results [^cp]
