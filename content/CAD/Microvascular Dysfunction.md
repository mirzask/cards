	- ∴ unrecognized CMD may explain the 20-40% of patients who continue to experience angina following “technically successfully” revascularization

- CMD includes either
	- [[Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF)#Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR)|CFR]] <2.0 and/or
	- IMR ≥25 and/or
	- evidence of coronary endothelial dysfunction, typically demonstrated with intracoronary [[Acetylcholine|ACh]] → angina w/ ST-depression and epicardial artery constriction
