- Involves graded exercise until physical fatigue, limiting chest pain (or discomfort), marked ischemia, or a drop in blood pressure occurs.[^cp]
- Candidates for exercise ECG are those:[^cp]
	- without disabling comorbidity (e.g., frailty, marked obesity (BMI >40 kg/m2), [[Peripheral Arterial Disease|PAD]], COPD, or orthopedic limitations) and capable of performing ADLs or able to achieve â‰¥5 METs *and*
	- without resting ST-T abnormalities (e.g., >0.5-mm ST depression, [[Left Ventricular Hypertrophy|LVH]], paced rhythm, [[Left Bundle Branch Block (BBB)|LBBB]], [[Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)]] pattern, or [[Digoxin|digoxin]] use).
- **Contraindications**
	- Abnormal ST changes on resting ECG, [[Digoxin|digoxin]], [[Left Bundle Branch Block (BBB)|LBBB]], Wolff-Parkinson- White pattern, ventricular paced rhythm (unless test is performed to establish exercise capacity and not for diagnosis of ischemia)
	- Unable to achieve â‰¥5 METs or unsafe to exercise
	- High-risk unstable angina or AMI (<2 d) i.e., active [[Chest Pain|ACS]]
	- Uncontrolled [[Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)|HF]]
	- Significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., [[Ventricular Tachycardia|VT]], complete atrioventricular block) or high risk for arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation
	- Severe symptomatic [[Aortic Stenosis|aortic stenosis]]
	- Severe systemic arterial [[Hypertension|hypertension]] (e.g., â‰¥200/110 mm Hg)
	- Acute illness (e.g., acute PE, acute myocarditis/pericarditis, acute aortic dissection)
- Widely available and inexpensive
- Interpretable ECG
- Requires ability to exercise to an adequate level
- Who should you test?
	- Intermediate-risk ASx adults (including considering starting a vigorous exercise program), particularly when attention is paid to exercise capacity
- Limited diagnostic accuracy
	- sensitivity ~60% & specificity ~70%
- Avoid if pre-existing ECG abnormalities
- What are you looking for?
	- See slide
- Prognostic importance of **functional capacity**
	- Once > 10 METS your prognosis, regardless of whether you have CAD or not, is quite good)
