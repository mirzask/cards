# Patient Preparation

- Same for [[Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|PET]] and [[Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)|SPECT]]
- Fast for ≥6 hrs (except water intake)
- Avoid caffeine for ≥12 hours
- Avoid theophylline-containing medications for ≥ 48 hours
# Vasodilators

- Most commonly, vasodilators are used to ↑ blood flow to normally perfused areas of the myocardium, uncovering potential areas of decreased perfusion caused by fixed coronary stenoses. 
- All vasodilators act through the [[Adenosine|adenosine]] pathway leading to vascular smooth muscle vasorelaxation.

- Side effects with vasodilators [^sperry-blog]
	- Vasodilators are safe in patients with a history of COPD or asthma, but do not give vasodilators in a patient with a recent exacerbation or active wheezing.
	- ![[Pharmacologic Stressors-20240816214635385.webp]]
- Indications for reversal of vasodilators (although most side effects are self-limiting)
	- Indications for reversal include severe hypotension, 2nd- or 3rd-degree heart block, ST depression with angina, wheezing, or intolerable symptoms. 
	- [[Adenosine]] almost never requires reversal due to the short half-life. 
	- ==For mild symptoms, ask patient to consume coffee ☕️ or diet soda 🥤 after completing the test.==
	- Reversal agents:
		- Aminophylline 50-250mg IV over 1 minute (do not give if having a seizure as this lowers the seizure threshold).
		- IV theophylline 50mg slow injection over 1 minute.
		- IV caffeine 60mg in 25mL of D5W over 3-5 minutes.
		- PO caffeine 60-160mg
## [[Adenosine]]

- See [[Adenosine]]
- **Adenosine** directly activates the A2a receptor causing coronary vasodilation, but also activates other adenosine receptors.
- Half-life is 2-10 seconds.
- Off-target effects:
	- A1 receptor: AV block, chest pain and tachypnea
	- A2b receptor: peripheral vasodilation (headache, diarrhea)
	- A2b/A3 receptor: bronchospasm
- **Protocol**: continuous infusion of 140 ug/kg/min for 6 minutes, inject radiotracer at 3 minutes.
- **Contraindications**: bronchospasm, hypotension, heart block.

## Regadenoson (Lexiscan)

- **Regadenoson** (Lexiscan): Directly activates A2a receptors with high affinity and low off-target effects causing coronary vasodilation.
	- $\text{A}_{\text{2A}}$-selective adenosine receptor agonist
- Half-life for hyperemia is 3-5 minutes. 
	- Peak-effect onset at ~1 min post bolus injection with a duration of approximately 8 to 10 minutes at ≥80% peak effect
	- Triphasic half-life so may have side effects of headache, chest pain, diarrhea for 15-20 minutes.
- Off-target effects are less than with adenosine.
- **Protocol**: rapid injection over 10 seconds followed by saline flush. Radionuclide is injected 10-20 seconds after saline.
- **Caution**: seizures, LBBB, pacemaker.
- Bradyarrhythmias with regadenoson are thought to be secondary to vagal stimulation via the A2a receptor in the hypothalamus and nucleus solitarius.
- ADVANCE trial compared Regadenoson vs [[Adenosine]]
	- Run-in phase to ensure all participants tolerated adenosine
	- tl;dr: regadenoson provided similar Dx information compared to standard adenosine infusion. There were no serious AEs with regadenoson and regadenoson was better tolerated.

## Dipyridamole (Persantine)

- **Dipyridamole** (Persantine): Phosphodiesterase inhibitor that prevents intracellular reuptake of adenosine.
- Half-life: Maximal hyperemia in 15 minutes. Alpha half-life is 30-60 minutes, beta half-life 10 hours.
- Off-target effects: Similar potential to adenosine. May have late symptoms after aminophylline reversal agents have worn off.
- **Protocol**: Infusion over 4 minutes, then inject radiotracer 3-5 min after dipyridamole infusion is complete.
- Consider using preferentially if history of seizure, pacemaker, LBBB.

The rate of side effects for vasodilator agents are seen in the [[Pharmacologic Stressors#Vasodilators|above]] table.

# [[Dobutamine]]

- Beta-adrenergic agonist: $\beta_1 >> \beta_2$
- Hemodynamic effects similar to exercise
- Increases in coronary flow less than vasodilator stress
- Dose increased incrementally to 40 mcg/min/kg
- [[Atropine]] administered to increase HR if required
- Use in pts unable to exercise with a contraindication to vasodilator stress
- Side-effects: palpitations, CP, dyspnea, headache, arrhythmia, Bezold-Jarisch reflex
- Contraindications same as for exercise stress
