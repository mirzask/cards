- [[Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)]]
	- For SVT, doses of 6 to 12 mg IV bolus are commonly used.
- [[Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)|Fractional flow reserve (FFR)]] measurements: adenosine to get coronary hyperemia
	- For inducing coronary hyperemia for [[Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR)|FFR]] measurements, 140 µg/kg/min given via IV or adenosine given via intracoronary (50–100 mcg for the right coronary artery [RCA] and 100 to 200 µg for the left coronary artery [LCA]) produces optimal results.
	- IV adenosine infusions produce sustained hyperemia after 1 to 2 minutes. Adenosine hyperemia lasts less than 60 seconds after drug administration is ended.
