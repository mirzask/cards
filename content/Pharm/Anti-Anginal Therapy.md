- Angina results from ischemia due to an imbalance between myocardial O2 requirements and myocardial O2 supply. 
	- This imbalance may occur secondary to:
		- hemodynamic demands (HR and BP), 
		- [[Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF)|myocardial blood flow]], or 
		- cardiomyocyte energetics
- **First-line antianginals** exert their effects through modification of hemodynamic mechanisms of ischemia. 
	- ==[[Beta-blockers|BBs]] should be prescribed as **initial therapy**== (Class 1)
	- If [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] contraindicated or angina is **refractory** (adjunct to [[Beta-blockers|BBs]]), 
		- [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]] (Class 1) *or*
		- long-acting [[Nitrates|nitrates]] (Class 1), which produce coronary vasodilation and ↓ BP
		- [[Ranolazine]] (Class 2a)
	- [[Ivabradine]] lowers HR
	- [[Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi)]] such as valsartan work through the renin-angiotensin system to reduce BP.
- As above, if [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] are contraindicated, leads to unacceptable side effects, or is ineffective, could try [[Ranolazine]] (Class 2a)
- [[Ranolazine]]'s antianginal effects are unique in that they are independent of significant changes to the HR–BP product
	- [[Ranolazine]] does not alter [[Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF)|myocardial blood flow]]. 
	- Recommended for patients with [[Stable Ischemic Heart Disease (SIHD)|stable ischemic heart disease]] with continued symptoms despite the use of [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] or who cannot use acceptable doses of [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] (Class 2a).
