- Dr. O'Keefe is not a fan of Atorva 80 mg b/c side effects of statins are dose-dependent.
	- You can get rhabdo with high doses of statins. Dr. O'Keefe gave an example of post-transplant patient on Atorva 80 who got rhabdo and died a few months later.
	- Delta between 40 mg and 80 mg of atorva is 48% → 51% reduction (delta is only 3%)
- Atorva is the 🌟
	- less nephrotoxicity compared to rosuvastatin
- Rule of thumb: 6% reduction when doubling a statin dose. Better off adding ezetimibe: zetia on its own 16% reduction, zetia + statin (synergistic effect): 25% reduction.
- Newborn baby LDL is 25-30 mg/dL. Hunter/gatherers have also been studied and have like 40-50 mg/dL.
	- You don't want a 0 LDL! Cholesterol is an important molecule, so you need some.
- Dr. O'Keefe gets nervous getting someones LDL < 30
- Side effects are not related to LDL level, rather related to statin dose.
- ⚠️ Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy 🤰and lactation
- Mnemonic for statin side effects "LIPITOR":
	- Liver effects
	- Increased blood sugar
	- Pain (muscles)
	- Impaired memory
	- Tiredness/Fatigue
	- Other (headaches)
	- Rhabdomyolysis
- SAMSON trial (BMJ, 2021)
	- 200 statin intolerant patients; "n-of-1" experiments
	- Compared atorva 20 mg vs placebo
	- Intolerable muscle sx: 9% in statin group discontinued, 7% discontinued placebo
- FDA did put out a warning on "brain fog" with statins, but meta-analysis showing ↓ Alzheimer's Risk 32%
- Dr. O'Keefe: "when I start someone on a statin, I also start them on **CoQ10**."
	- If patient c/o myalgias, he'll increase the dose of **CoQ10**

- Pitavastatin
	- a "cool" statin
	- Not as strong as atorva
	- 4 mg dose $\approx$ 20 mg of atorva
	- Unlike atorva, rosuva, simva, Pitavastatin less likely to induce DM in patients. If anything pitava can lower A1c by 0.1%

# High-Intensity [[Statins]]

- Rosuvastatin 20-40 & Atorvastatin 40-80 mg
- Maximally tolerated statin still the foundation
- ↓ LDL-C ~50%
- Can get creative to identify "maximally tolerated" to manage intolerance
	- Symmetric myalgias in large proximal muscle groups may indicate true statin intolerance; RARE
		- SAMSON trial - 90% of muscle symptoms attributed to "nocebo effect"
	- Rule out/correct other causes of muscle symptoms: hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, exercise
	- Hydrophilic statins potentially less muscle symptoms (rosuvastatin, pravastatin)
	- Up to 90% of initially intolerant do fine with re-challenge
		- Allow 2-4 week wash out

Variability in individual response to statins
