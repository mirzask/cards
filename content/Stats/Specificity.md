- The specificity is the proportion of patients without the event that are classified as low risk

$$
\text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}
$$
- Specificity (aka **true negative rate**) is defined as $p(\text{test result} = 0|\text{actual event} = 0)$, i.e., the probability of a negative test given that the truth is negative. 
- The **False Positive Rate** is defined as one minus the specificity, i.e. $\text{FPR} = 1 - \text{Specificity}$.
