# When TAVR over [[Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR)|SAVR]]?

- "porcelain" aorta
	- ![[Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)-20240904175800048.webp|426]]
	- risk of cross-clamping the calcific aorta
- Factors that ↑ cardiac surgical risk, e.g. prior chest radiation, severe lung, liver, or renal disease

# Management

- Antiplatelet: [[Aspirin|aspirin]] 75 to 100 mg daily is reasonable in the absence of other indications for oral anticoagulants (Class 2a)

# When palliation over TAVR?

- limited life expectancy (<12 months)
- irreversible severe LV dysfunction
- dementia
- severe frailty
- difficult aortic anatomy (annular size, calcium below valve, coronary location)
- difficult vascular access
- moderate or severe multiple-organ system disease

# Complications

## Paravalvular Leak

- If present, associated with a worse short- and long-term survival.[^pibarot]
	- ![[Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)-20240914213934483.webp]]
- Paravalvular regurgitation is more common with TAVR than with [[Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR)|SAVR]]
- Hemodynamic consequences arise b/c the LV has been used to being non-compliant and under pressure load for years, and now is facing a sudden ↑ volume load from the [[Aortic Regurgitation|AR]]
- Why PVLs after TAVI? Reasons include:
	- suboptimal placement of the prosthesis with incomplete sealing of the annulus by the valve stent,
	- incomplete approximation of the valve stent frame due to annular calcium or the native valve leaflets, or 
	- undersizing of the TAVI valve
- Use of 3D imaging, “oversizing” algorithms, newer-generation valves w/ sealing membranes/skirts to occupy the residual interstices have helped to reduce the rates of PVL.
