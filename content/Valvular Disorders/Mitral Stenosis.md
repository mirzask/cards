The analogy that is often used to describe stenotic lesions is covering a hose with your finger, you can sense the increased pressure when doing so. Further, this causes the jet of water to travel a greater distance.

- Auscultation
	- Opening snap (OS)
		- forceful opening of the MV when the pressure in the LA is greater than the pressure in the LV → OS of MS is a high-pitched early diastolic sound due to sudden tensing of the valve leaflets and subvalvular apparatus at the end of the opening excursion ([Source](https://www.escardio.org/Journals/E-Journal-of-Cardiology-Practice/Volume-16/Mitral-valve-disease-clinical-features-focusing-on-auscultatory-findings-including-auscultation-of-mitral-valve-prolapse))
		- occurs **40-120 milliseconds** after A2
		- A2-OS interval varies <u>inversely</u> with the severity of mitral stenosis
- In a patient with rheumatic MS who has Sx, but there is a discrepancy with resting [[Echo Hemodynamics|echo hemodynamics]], then do **exercise testing with hemodynamics**
	- exercise is preferred to [[Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography|dobutamine stress]] because it provides a more physiologic assessment
- Screening surveillance
	- Asymptomatic patients with mild or moderate MS should have surveillance echocardiograms every 3-5 years
	- Severe, but asymptomatic:
		- if MVA <1 cm2 → exercise treadmill testing should be performed yearly
		- if MVA 1-1.5 cm2: every 1-2 years


|                      | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Valve area (cm2)     | >1.5 | 1.0-1.5  | <1.0   |
| Mean gradient (mmHg) | <5   | 5-10     | >10    |
| PA pressure (mmHg)   | <30  | 30-50    | >50    |
| Diastolic PHT (ms)   |      | <150     | ≥150   |
The above criteria are based on a HR between 60 to 80 bpm and in sinus rhythm.

📝 Because of the variability of the mean pressure gradient with HR and forward flow, you may not see it included in the criteria for severity.

# Severe MS

- Mitral valve area (MVA) is considered significantly narrowed when <1.5 cm2

# Wilkins Score for Balloon Valvuloplasty

- Wilkins Echo score can predict the procedural success for mitral valvuloplasty based on valve structure.
- Grades each of the following components from 1 to 4:
	- leaflet mobility
	- leaflet thickness
	- calcification
	- abnormalities of the subvalvular apparatus
- Wilkins score ≤ 8 predicts a more favorable procedural, short, intermediate and long-term outcome (including survival).

# Echo in MS

- MS severity is assessed in 3 ways:
	- Doppler pressure gradient
		- Mean gradient is more important than peak gradient
		- ⚠️ may *overestimate* severity when transmitral flow is ↑ (e.g., with concomitant [[Mitral Regurgitation|MR]]) and may also be misleading when ventricular compliance is abnormal
	- Direct planimetry of MVA
		- Preferred approach as it is it is independent of loading conditions
	- [[Pressure Half Time (PHT)]] method
		- The more severe the MS, the slower the emptying into the LV and the longer the PHT will be.
		- ⚠️ may be inaccurate in patients with abnormalities of LA or LV compliance, those with associated [[Aortic Regurgitation|aortic regurgitation]], and those who have had recent mitral valvuloplasty.
		- ⚠️ has *not* been validated in patients with <u>calcific</u> MS

## Echo Math for MS

MVA using [[Pressure Half Time (PHT)|PHT]]
$$
\text{Mitral Valve Area (MVA)} = \frac{220}{\text{PHT}}
$$

MVA using PISA method
$$
\text{MVA} = \bigg( \frac{2 \pi \cdot {r_{\text{PISA}}}^2 \cdot \text{Aliasing velocity}}{V_{\text{max}}} \bigg) \times \frac{\alpha}{180}
$$
