- Involves **myxomatous degeneration** of the mitral valve leaflets ‚Üí eventually leads to structural incompetence and superior displacement of one or both mitral leaflets into the left atrium (LA) during systole [^morningstar]
- Estimated to affect 2% to 3% of individuals[^morningstar]
- Physical Exam
	- ü©∫: mid‚Äêsystolic "click" heard best at the apex
		- presence of a late systolic or holosystolic murmur can suggest the presence of [[Mitral Regurgitation|MR]]
- Diagnosis
	- Echo (gold standard)
- Patients who experience an increased burden of premature ectopic beats (such as [[Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)|PVCs]]) are at an increased risk of developing more severe, even life‚Äêthreatening arrhythmias.[^morningstar]

# Barlow disease

- diffuse, myxoid degeneration of the [[Mitral Valve|MV]] ‚Üí excess tissue in multiple valve segments, including leaflets and chordae ‚Üí (typically) both anterior and posterior MVP, as well as annular dilation
- Compared to [[Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)#Fibroelastic deficiency|fibroelastic deficiency]], Barlow disease is less frequently associated with chordal rupture.

# Fibroelastic deficiency

- Caused by abnormalities in connective tissue ‚Üí leaflet redundancy, chordal thinning and elongation ‚Üí MVP
	- The thinned and elongated tendinous chords in MVP are prone to **rupture**
- Chordal rupture may lead to flail leaflet and a sudden ‚Üë in [[Mitral Regurgitation|MR]] volume ([[Mitral Regurgitation#Acute MR|acute MR]])
