- Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac defect.
	- Affects 0.5% to 2.0% of adults
	- 3:1 male-to-female predominance, or as Dr. Skolnick put it "70% are men."
- While the BAV can be found in isolation, it is often associated with other congenital cardiac lesions.[^siu]
	- Dilation of the proximal ascending aorta secondary to abnormalities of the aortic media (most common)
		- [[Aortic Disease|Aortic aneurysms]] is 20% to 40%
		- [[Aortic Disease|Aortopathy]] is independent of valve function and consists of dilation of the aortic sinuses, the ascending aorta, or the arch. 
		- ∴, patients with BAV require careful evaluation of the aorta throughout their lifetimes
- Per Dr. Magalski:
	- If mom has it → 6% chance kid has it. 
	- If dad has it  → 3% chance for kid.
- Important clinical implications
	- Valve dysfunction
	- [[Aortic Disease|aortic dilatation]]
	- [[Aortic Dissection|aortic dissection]]
	- [[Endocarditis|endocarditis]]
- Despite the potential complications, 2 large contemporary series have demonstrated that life expectancy in adults with BAV disease is not shortened when compared with the general population.[^siu]
- [[Turner syndrome]]
	- BAV prevlance is ~30% in women with Turner syndrome; is 30-60x more frequent in women with Turner syndrome than in women with 46,XX.
	- By contrast, 7-18% of women with Turner syndrome have [[Aortic Coarctation|aortic coarctation]].
# Management

- Many undergoing aortic valve replacement will also need aortic root surgery b/c BAV is a disease of both the [[Aortic Valve|aortic valve]] and [[Aorta|aorta]] [^siu]

## Screening

- For patients with BAV, you should (at least once) scan entire aorta to screen for aortopathy with an MRA or CT
- Screen first-degree relatives for BAV or aortopathy with a TTE
## Surveillance

## Aortic Dilatation in BAV

- Prophylactic ascending aorta replacement is indicated when
	- Aorta ≥ 5.5 cm
	- Aorta ≥ 5 cm
		- if high risk features also present: uncontrolled [[Hypertension|hypertension]], personal history of [[Aortic Coarctation|coarctation]], family hx of [[Aortic Dissection|aortic dissection]] or early unexplained [[Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)|SCD]], and confirmed aortic diameter increase of > 0.3 cm/yr
	- Aorta ≥ 4.5 cm
		- if already going for aortic valve replacement (AVR) for another indicated reason, e.g. for [[Aortic Regurgitation|AR]] or [[Aortic Stenosis|AS]]
		- to prevent progressive dilatation of the aorta after you replace the valve
