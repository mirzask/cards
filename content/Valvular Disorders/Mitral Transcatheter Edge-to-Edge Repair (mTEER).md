- Approximates the anterior and posterior leaflets of the MV at the origin of the MR jet, creating a double-orifice MV that is similar to the surgical Alfieri stitch
- Echo features that portend benefit from mTEER include:
	- LVEF 20-50%,
	- LV end-systolic dimension <70 mm, and 
	- PASP <70 mm Hg
- Who will you recommend for a MitraClip?
	- Severe, symptomatic [[Mitral Regurgitation#Primary Mitral Regurgitation|primary MR]] with prohibitive risk of cardiac surgery (STS-Predicted Risk of Mortality â‰¥ 8% or high-risk characteristics) as assessed by a cardiac surgeon
	- Severe, symptomatic [[Mitral Regurgitation#Secondary Mitral Regurgitation|secondary MR]] on maximally tolerated GDMT
		- if MR severity and LV parameters are consistent with COAPT trial criteria
