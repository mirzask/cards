- All prosthetic heart valves have an expected amount of **stenosis**.
- Prosthetic valves are designed to have a small amount of **regurgitation**, i.e. “physiological closing volume.”

# Which valve should they get?

# Management

- Asymptomatic patients can generally be followed with a clinician examination **annually**.

## Anticoagulation

- In patients with a **mechanical** prosthetic valve, anticoagulation with [[Warfarin|warfarin]] is recommended (Class 1)
- Bioprosthetic valves
	- [[Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)|TAVI]]:
		- if low risk of bleeding, DAPT with [[Aspirin|aspirin]] 75 to 100 mg daily + [[Clopidogrel|clopidogrel]] 75 mg daily for 3-6 months post-implantation (Class 2a)
		- [[aspirin|aspirin]] 75 to 100 mg daily is reasonable (Class 2a)
	- Bioprosthetic SAVR: 
		- if low risk of bleeding, [[Warfarin|warfarin]] (Goal INR 2.5) for 3-6 months after surgery (Class 2a)
		- [[aspirin|aspirin]] 75 to 100 mg daily is reasonable (Class 2a)

## [[Endocarditis]] Prophylaxis


## Echo Surveillance

- Initial Echo
	- "In patients with a surgical or transcatheter prosthetic valve and in patients who have had valve repair, an initial postprocedural TTE study is recommended for evaluation of valve hemodynamics and ventricular function" (Class 1)
- Surveillance Echo
	- Guidelines recommend a follow-up echocardiogram 4-12 weeks after valve surgery to establish a new baseline.
		- Waiting several weeks allows for recovery of anemia, stabilization from any early postoperative fluid shifts, and stabilization from perioperative medications, which may alter valvular gradients and/or ventricular mechanics early on.
	- **Bioprosthetic valves**
		- In patients with a *bioprosthetic* **surgical valve**, TTE at 5 and 10 years and then annually after implantation is reasonable, <u>even in the absence of a change in clinical status</u>. (Class 2a)
		- In patients with a *bioprosthetic* [[Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)|TAVI]], <u>TTE annually</u> is reasonable (Class 2a)
- Clinical deterioration → get a TTE (Class 1)
	- If TTE doesn't show valve dysfunction, get additional imaging (TEE, gated cardiac CT, or fluoro) (Class 1)
