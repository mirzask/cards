# Acute MR

- Common causes include:
	- [[Endocarditis]]
	- [[Mitral Regurgitation#Papillary muscle rupture|Papillary muscle rupture]] or chordal muscle rupture, e.g. after recent MI or infarction
		- Can result in flail leaflet
- Sudden ‚Üë in LA and LV volume in the absence of compensatory LV or atrial dilation.
- Management
	- Urgent surgery

## Post-MI Mitral Regurgitation

### Papillary muscle rupture

- Complicates 1-5% of acute Medications
- Usually 2-7 days after the acute ischemic event; typically first MI
- Posteromedial papillary muscle more commonly ruptured (10x more likely) due to have single blood supply (posterior descending artery)
	- The anterolateral papillary muscle has dual blood supply
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Exam may not have feature a hyperdynamic precordium or audible murmur
	- d/t rapid and complete equalization of pressure between the LV and LA. 
	- By contrast, [[Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)|ventricular septal rupture]] would present similarly, but you'll hear a loud murmur.

### Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation

# Chronic [[Mitral Regurgitation]]

- "If you see MR, you need to ask **why**?"
	- "A comprehensive evaluation of valvular regurgitation should include identifying the mechanism and the severity of valvular regurgitation, along with adaptation of the heart to the volume overload."

![[Mitral Regurgitation-20240922132907877.webp|442]]

- Results in LV volume overload ‚Üí ventricular (and atrial) remodeling w/ eccentric hypertrophy, i.e. LV dilation w/o increased wall thickness.
- Can be tolerated for several years. Only after several years (typically), may it lead to ‚Üì contractility and systolic dysfunction ‚Üí ‚Üë pulmonary venous pressure, ‚Üì SV and ‚Üì CO.
	- ‚Üë LAP: pulmonary congestion, [[Pulmonary Hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]], and [[Atrial Fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]]

- Primary or Secondary (functional) MR?
	- differentiates 1Àö lesions of the mitral leaflets and subvalvular apparatus from 2Àö dysfunction d/t annular or LV dilatation/remodeling and/or dysfunction.
- Most common causes of MR: [[Mitral Regurgitation#Secondary Mitral Regurgitation|Secondary MR]] is the most prevalent form of MR, followed by [[Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)]], ischemic MR.
- Primary MR includes:
	- myxomatous ‚àÜ, notably [[Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)]]
	- [[Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC)]]
	- [[Rheumatic Heart Disease]]
	- [[Connective Tissue Disease]]
	- radiation therapy ‚ò¢Ô∏è
	- adverse effects of medications üíä

- Carpentier Classification
	- Type I: normal leaflet motion
	- Type Il: increased leaflet mobility
	- Type Ill: decreased leaflet mobility
		- IlIA: systolic and diastolic
		- IIIB: systolic only

- Echo
	- Don't forget to provide information regarding the associated conditions or sequelae of MR, such as [[Pulmonary Hypertension|pulmonary hypertension]], [[Tricuspid Regurgitation|tricuspid regurgitation]], LA dilation, and ventricular dilation or systolic dysfunction
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è In the presence of severe primary or secondary MR, use of LVEF may overestimate systolic function because of the lower impedance of the LA chamber.
		- Be sure to check LVESD
	- TEE can also be helpful given its ‚Üë spatial resolution and the proximity of the probe to the MV.
		- MV surgical views are üî•
	- [[Echo Doppler]]
		- vena contracta width, ERO, spatial distribution of MR jet w/in the LA, flow convergence
- Screening
	- After the initial echocardiographic evaluation, repeat echocardiography is indicated for patients with <u>moderate or greater MR</u>, even in the absence of symptoms
	- Frequency
		- Severe MR: every 6-12 months
		- Moderate MR: every 1-2 years
		- Mild MR: every 3-5 years
		- ‚ö†Ô∏è Repeat echocardiography is also recommended for patients with *any* degree of MR and a change in clinical status or physical examination findings.

## Management

### Surgery

- Indications:
	- Symptomatic
	- Asymptomatic + high-risk features:
		- LVEF ‚â§ 60%
		- LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) ‚â• 40 mm
		- New [[Atrial Fibrillation]]
		- PASP >50 mmHg

- "A mechanical problem requires a mechanical solution"
	- Primary MR is a mechanical problem of the leaflet coaptation that only has a mechanical solution, i.e. MV intervention

## Secondary [[Mitral Regurgitation]]

- Secondary MR occurs in approximately 65% of cases reported with left ventricular dysfunction or remodeling as the predominant cause.
