- The term ‚Äò**[[Pericarditis#Incessant Pericarditis|incessant]]**‚Äô has been adopted for cases with persistent symptoms without a clear-cut remission after the acute episode.
- The term ‚Äò**[[Pericarditis#Chronic Pericarditis|chronic]]**‚Äô generally refers‚Äîespecially for [[Pericardial Effusion|pericardial effusions]]‚Äîto disease processes lasting >3 months
- [[Pericarditis#Recurrent Pericarditis|Recurrent pericarditis]] is diagnosed with a documented first episode of acute pericarditis, a symptom-free interval of 4‚Äì6 weeks or longer and evidence of subsequent recurrence of pericarditis
	- recurrence rate after an initial episode of pericarditis ranges from 15 to 30%, and may increase to 50% after a first recurrence in patients not treated with [[Colchicine|colchicine]], esp if Tx w/ steroids.

# Acute pericarditis
- Work-up: CBC, ESR, CRP, CK, troponin, 12-lead ECG, CXR
- Echo
- Empiric therapy
	- Aspirin 750-1,000 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 250-500 mg every 1-2 weeks
	- Ibuprofen 600 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 200-400 mg every 1-2 weeks.
	- Colchicine 0.6 mg BID (if weight > 70 kg) or 0.5 mg daily (if weight < 70 kg). 
	- PPI for gastroprotection (if prescribed ASA or NSAIDs)
- Activity limitations
	- If not involved in athletic sports, recommend restrict physical activity beyond ordinary sedentary life until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP
	- If athlete, recommended to return to competitive sports only after symptoms have resolved and diagnostic tests (i.e. CRP, ECG and echocardiogram) have normalized
	- Duration: Expert consensus recommends activity restriction for a minimum of 3 months for athletes, whereas a shorter period (until remission) may be suitable for non-athletes.
- Dispo: close follow-up in 1 week to assess therapeutic response

- Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory pericardial syndrome with or without pericardial effusion.
- Poor prognostic markers ‚Äì if present, may warrant hospital admission
	- Fever
	- Subacute course, i.e. Sx over several days w/o a clear-cut onset
	- Large [[Pericardial Effusion|pericardial effusion]], i.e. diastolic echo-free space >2 cm
	- [[Pericardial Tamponade|Cardiac tamponade]]
	- Failure to respond w/in 7 days to NSAIDs

## Diagnosis of Acute Pericarditis

- Clinical diagnosis can be made with ‚â•2 of the following criteria:
	- [[Chest Pain|chest pain]] (>85‚Äì90% of cases)‚Äîtypically sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward
	- pericardial friction rub (‚â§33% of cases)‚Äîa superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope ü©∫ over the left sternal border
	- ECG changes (up to 60% of cases)‚Äîwith new widespread ST elevation or PR depression in the acute phase
		- NOTE: ECG changes imply inflammation of the epicardium, since the parietal pericardium itself is electrically inert
	- [[Pericardial Effusion|pericardial effusion]] (up to 60% of cases, generally mild)
- CRP, ESR, WBC elevation is common and may be helpful to monitor disease activity and therapeutic efficacy
- Increased markers of myocardial injury (e.g. CK, troponin) may suggest concomitant [[Myocarditis|myocarditis]]

- Empiric therapy
	- [[Aspirin]] 750-1,000 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 250-500 mg every 1-2 weeks
	- Ibuprofen 600 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 200-400 mg every 1-2 weeks.
	- [[Colchicine]] 0.6 mg BID (if weight \> 70 kg) or 0.5 mg daily (if weight \< 70 kg). Often prescribed as adjunct to [[Aspirin]]/NSAID. Tapering is not mandatory.
		- Contraindicated if severe renal impairment, pregnant/lactating women
	- üìù [[Steroids]] only used if contraindications and failure to ASA/NSAIDs. If used, low to moderate doses (i.e. prednisone 0.2--0.5 mg/kg/day or equivalent) should be recommended instead of high doses (i.e. prednisone 1.0 mg/kg/day or equivalent). initial dose should be maintained until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP, then tapering should be considered.
- PPI for gastroprotection (if prescribed ASA or NSAIDs)
- **Activity limitations**
	- If *not* involved in athletic sports, recommend restrict physical activity beyond ordinary sedentary life until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP
	- If <u>athlete</u> üèÉ, recommended to return to competitive sports only after symptoms have resolved and diagnostic tests (i.e. CRP, ECG and echocardiogram) have normalized
	- **Duration**: Expert consensus recommends activity restriction for a minimum of 3 months for athletes, whereas a shorter period (until remission) may be suitable for non-athletes.
- **Dispo**: close follow-up in 1 week to assess therapeutic response

- Try to target underlying etiology (if identifiable cause present)
- Aspirin or NSAIDs remain the mainstay of therapy + Colchicine as adjunct
- If incomplete response to ASA/NSAID + colchicine combo, then can *consider* **steroids** as an add-on to low-/moderate-dose ASA/NSAID + colchicine, i.e. 'triple therapy'
	- See ESC 2015 guidelines for recommendations on tapering steroid therapy

- Drugs such as IVIG, anakinra and azathioprine may be considered in cases of proven infection-negative, corticosteroid-dependent, recurrent pericarditis not responsive to colchicine after careful assessment of the costs, risks and eventually consultation by multidisciplinary experts, including immunologists and/or rheumatologists, in the absence of a specific expertise. It is also mandatory to educate the patient and his/her caregivers about the clinical risks related to immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive drugs and the safety measures to adopt during the treatment.
- As a last resort, **pericardiectomy** may be considered, but only after a thorough trial of unsuccessful medical therapy, and with referral of the patient to a centre with specific expertise in this surgery.
