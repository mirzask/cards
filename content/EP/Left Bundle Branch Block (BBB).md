- **Complete LBBB** 
	- QRS duration ≥120 ms
	- Broad notched or slurred R wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5, and V6) and an occasional RS pattern in V5 and V6 attributed to displaced transition of QRS complex
	- Absent Q waves in leads I, V5, and V6, but in the lead aVL, a narrow Q wave may be present in the absence of myocardial pathology
	- R peak time >60 ms in leads V5 and V6 but normal in leads V1, V2, and V3, when small initial R waves can be discerned in the precordial leads
	- ST and T waves usually opposite in direction to QRS
- **Incomplete LBBB**
	- QRS duration between 110-119 ms
	- [[Left Ventricular Hypertrophy|LVH]] pattern
	- R peak time >60 ms in leads V4, V5, and V6
	- Absence of Q wave in leads I, V5, and V6
