- The type of information (heart rate trends, PAC/PVC burden, SVT/VT episodes, AF burden with rate information) is the same for MCOTs and for Holters.  _The distinguishing feature of these two monitors is whether the device records (Holter) or transmits (MCOT), not the quality of the information provided by the study._  With the availability of extended Holter monitors and MCOT monitoring, looping event recorders have essentially become obsolete.
# Holter Monitor

- A Holter monitor is a self-contained recording device which does *not* transmit, but continuously records for the duration of the study. 
- When the study is complete the device is returned, and the recording is downloaded, analyzed using automated algorithms, reviewed by technicians (either in-house or contracted), and summarized in a preliminary report which is then finalized by physician interpretation. 
- A Holter monitor can be the traditional 3 or 12 lead 24 hour monitors which we typically think of, or it can be a patch which records for up to 2 weeks (eg Zio XT patch).

# MCOT Monitor

- MCOT stands for “Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry.” 
- The monitoring period can be as long as 4 weeks.
- At the completion of the specified monitoring period, a preliminary summary report is generated by the monitoring company and then reviewed and interpreted by a physician, similar to a Holter type monitor. 
- These devices transmit ECG recordings real time, are subjected to automated alerts, and can be responded to by technicians (similar to inpatient telemetry).
- Alerts that meet specified criteria are communicated to the referring practice day or night (although day and night time criteria differ). 
- Daily reports are generated and are reviewed by our nurses and, when needed, by our physicians.
- MCOT studies are more resource intensive for the monitoring service and are more expensive 💰than Holter type monitors.
