#cardiology #shock 


- Impella microaxial flow pumps are placed fluoroscopically in retrograde fashion through the femoral artery, axillary artery, or ascending aorta
- Blood ðŸ©¸ is suctioned from an inlet (located just superior to the catheterâ€™s pigtail in the LV cavity) and then delivered through the Impella outlet, which is seated just above the aortic valve.
- The distal portion of the Impella is a pigtail configuration that is meant to reside in the mid LV approximately ==3.5 cm below the aortic annulus==. The ==Impella 5.5 should be 5 cm from the aortic valve annulus==.
- Uses: high-risk PCI, post-MI shock, ADHF, post-cardiotomy shock, etc.
- Complications
	- hemolysis
	- pigment-induced nephropathy
	- vascular access complications, e.g. limb ischemia, major bleeding
	- pericardial tamponade
	- MV impingement w/ [[Mitral Regurgitation|mitral regurgitation]]
	- thrombosis â†’ device failure

## Impella RP Right Ventricular Support Device

- delivers blood from the cannula inlet seated in the inferior vena cava to the outlet located above the pulmonic valve within the proximal pulmonary artery.
	- The pump is inserted under fluoroscopic guidance via the femoral vein into the right atrium, across the tricuspid and pulmonic valves, and then into the pulmonary artery.

>Because access is presently available only via the femoral vein, patients are not able to ambulate.

# Resuscitation (CPR, AED) in a patient with Impella

CPR should be performed based on loss of perfusion pressure and/or flow, rather than on electrocardiogram or flattening of the arterial waveform, since the device can often maintain adequate perfusion pressures despite ventricular tachycardia.

- ==**Consider reducing Impella P-level to P-2 during CPR**== to minimize potential damage to cardiac structures (especially when suction alarm) and increase the level of support again at return of circulation. 
	- This also resolves the arrhythmia when it was induced by suction events. (Continuing support, however, can be considered for patients that have extremely poor native heart function).
- An Impella device is *not* a contraindication for electrical defibrillation.
- Assess Impella position after return of circulation, to ensure the Impella has not dislodged during CPR.
# Repositioning an Impella

- â†“ to P2
- Unlock the fasteners to allow you to rotate the wire
- Teamwork:
	- Have one person press down on the *blue button* ðŸ”µ
	- Have another person holding the Echo probe so you can see the Impella device to ensure appropriate repositioning
	- You can rotate the wire to reposition
- Once done getting the Impella repositioned:
	- release the *blue button* ðŸ”µ,
	- fasten everything back up,
	- slowly ramp back up the P-level, e.g. â†‘ by 2 every 2 minutes or so

# Impella Controller

- Changing the P-level â†’ Impella Flow (bottom left of controller) should adjust as well
- Waveforms ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4vQxQRmAIw))
	- Placement Signal (red ðŸ”´)
		- Ao and LV waveforms
		- The Ao waveform is from the optical sensor where the cannula and outflow meet
		- The LV waveform is derived from optical sensor and motor current
	- Motor Current (green ðŸŸ¢)
		- the amount of energy and flow through the cannula
		- peaks on motor current waveform are when valve open, valleys are when valve closed
		- Normal: pulsatile waveform
		- If flat waveform, then something is up. For example, malpositioned such that aortic valve no longer creating pressure gradient across the cannula
- Bottom of screen ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4vQxQRmAIw))

# Impella Alarms


![[Impella-20240806155118841.webp]]
![[Impella-20240806155129698.webp]]

## Position unknown (white banner)

- Often arises in situations where the patient has low native heart pulsatility
- When a patient has poor native ventricular function, the placement signal may remain pulsatile; however, the amplitude will be dampened.
	- The green waveform may even appear as if its almost a *flat line*

## Impella Position In Ventricle (red banner)

- Arises if catheter is fully in the ventricle

![[Impella-20240806155200459.webp]]

## Impella Position Wrong (red banner)

- Arises in the following circumstances:
	- catheter completely in the aorta
	- if the inlet and outlet areas are in the ventricle and the open pressure area is in the aorta

![[Impella-20240806155215767.webp]]
## Suction Alarms (yellow banner)

Suction events are amongst the most common problems encountered during Impella mana-
gement in the cardiac intensive care unit and should be avoided at any time. Longer standing
suction events can lead to haemolysis and insufficient circulatory support. ([Source](https://www.escardio.org/static-file/Escardio/Subspecialty/ACCA/Publications/ACVC%20Handbook%20MCS%202022/ESC-HandbookMCS-IMPELLA%20TROUBLESHOOTING%20AND%20RESUSCITATION.pdf))

- Common causes
	- Contact of the Impella device inlet with a ventricular structure (mitral valve leaflet, chordal structure, ventricular wall,â€¦).
	- Abnormal / altered device positions.
	- Insufficient preload.
	- Device related thrombus formation.
	- Excessive support to a recovering heart.
- Potential harms that may arise
	- Decrease the level of support that is provided to the circulation, which may result in hemodynamic deterioration.
	- Increase shear stress for red blood cells, resulting in hemolysis. It is also possible to encounter hemolysis without overt suction alarms in case of subtle abnormalities.
		- The preferred test to quantify hemolysis is the plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb).

## Purge Alarms

### Excessive purge system pressures

- Causes
	- Kinked tubing
	- High viscosity of purge fluid
	- Obstruction of the purge system/outlet (e.g., thrombus)
- Diagnosis/Solution:
	- Check for kinked tubing
	- Consider decreasing glucose viscosity if higher than 5%
	- Consider replacing the purge cassette
	- Local thrombolysis is used by some centrers with good results; but data remain scarce

### Low purge system pressures

- Causes:
	- Leakage somewhere in the purge system
	- Low purge solution viscosity
- Diagnosis/Solution:
	- Check for leakage in the system
	- Consider replacing the purge cassette
	- Consider increasing the glucose viscosity in the purge fluid if less than 20%

# HARVI with Burkhoff

- Pump Flow and "HQ Curve"
	- H stands for pressure head and Q stands for flow
- HQ curve is the hemodynamic signature of the pump
- Curve modified by the RPMs
- Hemodynamic effect
	- ventricle is unloading: â†“ volume in the ventricle, â†“ PCWP
	- âˆ† in shape from rectange to triangle b/c "continuously unloading" (always pumping independent of phase in the cardiac cycle) and loss of isovolumetric contraction and isovolumetric relaxation
	- LV-aortic pressure uncoupling (doesn't always occur)
		- â†‘ aortic pressure
		- â†“ LV pressure
		- during cardiac cycle pressure gradient varies (large pressure gradient during diastole, small gradient during systole d/t âˆ† in LV pressure)
	- Flow waveform tells you about the placement of the impella device
		- **flat line** (no pressure gradient) at a high flow (it'll pump a lot of blood) if misplaced ==in the aorta==
		- flat line can also occur d/t other causes, e.g. if no LV contraction, severe RHF where LV is completely underfilled; i.e. any condition where not able to generate phasic pressure âˆ†
- Energetic effects
