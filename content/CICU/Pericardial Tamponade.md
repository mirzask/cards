  - Cardiac Tamponade

Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening, slow or rapid compression of the heart due to the pericardial accumulation of fluid, pus, blood, clots or gas as a result of inflammation, trauma, rupture of the heart or [[Aortic Dissection|aortic dissection]].

- H&P
    - Clinical signs in a patient with cardiac tamponade include tachycardia, hypotension, **pulsus paradoxus**, raised jugular venous pressure, muffled heart sounds
    - ECG:
        -   low-voltage
        -   electrical alternans
        -   May show signs of [[Pericarditis|pericarditis]]
    -   Chest imaging (e.g., CXR) with enlarged cardiac silhouette
    -   Classic signs include Beck's triad
        -   neck vein distension with elevated JVP,
        -   pulsus paradoxus,
        -   diminished heart sounds
    -   Pericardial friction rub can be heard if concomitant pericarditis
- Fun fact: cath will show equilibration of average diastolic pressure and characteristic respiratory reciprocation of cardiac pressures, i.e. an inspiratory increase on the right and a concomitant decrease on the left---the proximate cause of **pulsus paradoxus**.
    -   Except in low-pressure tamponade, diastolic pressures throughout the heart are usually in the range of 15-30 mmHg.

# Diagnosis
## Echo in Cardiac Tamponade

-  Echo is the single most useful diagnostic tool to identify [[Pericardial Effusion|pericardial effusion]] and estimate its size, location and degree of hemodynamic impact
-   Early diastolic collapse of RV
-   Late diastolic collapse of RA
-   abnormal ventricular septal motion
-   exaggerated respiratory variability (\>25%) in mitral inflow velocity
    -   \> 40% of tricuspid inflow?
-   inspiratory decrease and expiratory increase in pulmonary vein diastolic forward flow,
-   respiratory variation in ventricular chamber size,
-   aortic outflow velocity (echocardiographic **pulsus paradoxus**) and
-   inferior vena cava plethora

## Waveforms

- RAP waveform has an attenuated/absent Y-descent
	- Occurs d/t diastolic equalization of pressures in the RA and RV + lack of effective flow across the TV in *early* ventricular diastole
- Can also see **equalization** of <u>mean</u> RA, RV, and PA **diastolic pressures** and <u>mean</u> PCWP
