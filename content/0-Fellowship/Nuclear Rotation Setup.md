To interpret a nuclear study there are multiple programs and steps that need to be followed to ensure accurate interpretation and complete dictation. When logging in for the day I will open all four programs located below to setup my workstation. Below is an outline 

# Cedars Terminal (CSI) 

- Located on all computers in nuclear lab as well as the CT reading swing office in the hallway
- Login information:
	- Username: CVfellow
	- Password: (ask on the fellows WhatsApp)
- Locate study by searching patient name in the top 
- Once patient is selected, bottom of screen will populated the associated nuclear study files
- Locate the QP/QS file and left click to select it
- After selecting/highlighting the above file, in the top left find and click the red QP/QS icon to open the study
	- It is important to open all studies through this process to ensure the processing from the tech is correctly applied to your study. Otherwise the images you review may look different compared to what your staff will open when you present your study! 

# CardioServ

- All studies have an associated EKG strip that needs to be interpreted into the first box of your study interpretation 
- There are multiple ways to access the cardio server 
	- Desktop icon for Cardioserv ‚Äì should be on most computers in the nuclear lab
	- Epic client ‚Üí Clinical references (CTL +8) -> Cardioserv 
	- SLH Access Citrix Hub ‚Üí Apps, all ‚Üí CardioServ
		- üìù  not all fellows will have this app in Citrix. You can request access using eRequest.
- Open CardioServ ‚Äì by whichever preferred method ‚Äì p# and password will auto populate 
- Setup the inbox in the top left with the following parameters
	- `Site: All`
	- `Type: STRESS`
	- `Status: Unconfirmed`
	- Search by: Name
- Then search the patient name in the below box and open the associated strips 
	- üí°Tip: You can use the page down button and the right arrow to navigate through the especially long strips to increase speed.

# Syngo Via

- Low resolution CT for attenuation correction and Cardioscan CTs are reviewed through syngo.via
- Locate ‚Äúsyngo.via Single Sign On‚Äù on the Desktop ‚Äì open this link
- Search for your patient by last name and double click the study to open

# Dragon Dictation

- Open dragon by way of the ‚ÄúDragon Medical One‚Äù icon on the desktop or via epic client

# Nuclear Database

- The Chrome desktop shortcut labeled ‚ÄúNuclear Database‚Äù is how you navigate to your study dictation
- Open the shortcut ‚Äì your P# and password will automatically populate and log you in. 
	- All current fellows have been granted access. Please email Rob if there is any issues with logging in. 
- Navigate to the `Phys Dictation List` on the left hand side (towards the bottom)
	- ![[Nuclear Rotation Setup-20241023085912368.webp|504]]
- Clicking the list will open you to the reading list for prepared/ pending studies of the day separated out by types: `PET`, `Stress first SPECT` and `2 Day SPECT`
- Search for your patient name in the list and click to open the dictation for your study
- Utilize the Dragon Dictation to populate a template for your study
- Click `Save` in the bottom left after completing your dictation
- All of the fellow pended studies will now be found at the bottom of the ‚ÄúPhys Dictation List‚Äù. 
- When staff is reviewing, they will open the study, make edits and click the drop down box to change from incomplete to complete which will push the study to Epic.

Quantitative evaluation shows a summed stress score of x, a summed rest score of x, and a summed difference score of x. This represents a myocardial ischemic fraction of x%.

Gated SPECT images shows that the left ventricle is normal/enlarged in size and shows normal systolic performance. The LVEF at rest is x% and x% on post-stress images. No regional wall motion abnormalities are present during either stress or rest imaging.

2. Left ventricular systolic function is normal/abnormal with (no)/x regional wall motion abnormalities. Left/Right ventricular hypertrophy/dilation is present.

## Exercise MPI with Combined Conclusion

```text
Reason for Study: Preoperative evaluation prior to non-cardiac surgery.

Clinical History: Mr. [XXXXXX] is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia with no prior known coronary artery disease who is currently asymptomatic. He has not had prior coronary angiography and has a SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging study from [xx/xx/xxxx] for comparison.

Stress ECG: (not provided in this appendix for brevity).

Isotope Administration

This was a gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging study. A one-day rest-stress imaging protocol was followed. The isotope used for imaging was 99mTc-sestamibi. Rest imaging was performed after an injection of 7.1 mCi. Stress imaging was performed after an injection of 21.3 mCi.

Nuclear Stress Findings

Nuclear Study Quality

Overall imaging quality was good.

Perfusion Conclusion

LV perfusion is probably normal.

Perfusion Defect #1

There is a small region with moderate reduction in uptake in the apical to mid anterior segment(s) that is predominately reversible. There is normal wall motion in the defect area. The defect appears to be shifting breast artifact, but ischemia cannot be ruled out. The perfusion defect is visually present but not quantitatively significant.

Perfusion Comments

There is no evidence of transient ischemia dilation (TID). The rest study indicates well-preserved viability.

Function Comments

Left ventricular function post-stress was normal with an ejection fraction of 63%. The stress end-diastolic cavity size was normal (52 mL/m2). The stress end-systolic cavity size was normal (19 mL/m2).

Interpretation Summary

- The stress electrocardiogram was positive for electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia.
- The Duke Treadmill Score was intermediate risk at -5.
- The patient developed typical angina at peak stress.
- LV perfusion is probably normal.
- The small region with moderate reduction in uptake in the apical to mid anterior segment(s) appears to be shifting breast artifact but ischemia cannot be ruled out.
- Left ventricular function post-stress was normal with an ejection fraction of 63%.

Nuclear and Stress Combined Conclusion

The ECG and SPECT portions of the stress study are discordant, but the following factors support an intermediate risk of inducible myocardial ischemia:

- Poor exercise workload achieved during stress.
- Anginal symptoms during stress.
- Multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

Further cardiac evaluation for ischemic heart disease could be considered, especially in the setting of progressive or typical angina.

Nuclear Prior Study

Compared with the prior study dated [xx/xx/xxxx], the perfusion defect is new. There has been no significant change in left ventricular function.
